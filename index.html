          <li>Background</li>
            <p>I'm from Sacramento, CA which is in Northern California about two hours north of San Francisco and two hours south of the Lake Tahoe/Reno area. My Wife and I moved to Las Vegas the day after we got back from our Honeymoon in October 2015. My prior work experience is primarily in the insurance industry ranging from customer service and sales to an operations analyst. I left the insurance industry last year and went to work in the gaming industry working primarily in surveillance.

      <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sports</li>
            <div>I'm a huge fan of the <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf"> San Francisco Giants</a> and the <a href="http://www.49ers.com/">San Francisco 49ers</a>. Before moving out to Las Vegas I was fortunate enough to be able to go to many games and it's one of the things I miss most about living in Sacramento.</div>
          <li>Travel</li>
            <div>I enjoy traveling to new places and expereiencing new cultures. I've been to Mexico many times as well as Costa Rica and Thailand and I hope to be adding a few more places to my list soon.</div>
          <li>Coding</li>
            <div>I first experienced coding when I took an Intro to programming class at CSN. I found that I really enjoyed the process of breaking down problems into smaller parts and figuring out how to input that into a computer.
